Using Selenium to create a bot that plays a cookie clicker game: https://orteil.dashnet.org/experiments/cookie/

The purpose of the game is to generate and collect as much money(cookies) as possible, by clicking The Cookie. 
As the player collects more money he can buy items from the store that help him generate more cookies.

The bot plays the game for 5 minutes, checking the store, at a set time that gradually increases, to buy the most
expensive item that he can afford to help generate more money.
